# PDDL
> Planning Domain Definition Language
## Overview
This repository contains domain and instances PDDL files.

## Domain


For each IPC domain, there is a top-level readme containing an informal description of the domain.

Problem instances reside in the instances subdirectory and are of the form instance-x.pddl, where x â‰¥ 1 (without leading zeros).

With most domains, there is only one domain description for all instances, domain.pddl. In some cases, a proper domain is provided for each instance, in which case the domain descriptions are stored in a domains subdirectory.
